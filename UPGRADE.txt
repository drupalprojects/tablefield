Upgrading from tablefield-7.x-2.x to tablefield-7.x-3.x:

A database update script using hook_update_N is provided that takes care of:
- converting existing table to a new database structure
- moving existing field settings to diplay settings instead, maintaining the
  values.

It should be noted that the database structure has fundamentally changed. If you use custom modules that interact directly with the tablefield data you would probably have to revise the code.

In any case, backup your current database and take note of what current version of the module you use (of make a copy if it's a dev version). After you run update.php (or drush updb -y) check your existing tables and their settings thoroughly.
